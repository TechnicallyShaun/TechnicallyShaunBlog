# TBA

## What am I trying to do?

[To be written: Describe the personal motivation and goals behind implementing a PKM/second brain system. What problems are you trying to solve? What outcomes do you want to achieve?]

## What is PKM Vs second brain Vs other?

### Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)

[To be written: Define PKM - the practice of capturing, organizing, and retrieving information for personal use. Emphasis on individual learning and knowledge retention.]

### Second Brain

[To be written: Explain the second brain concept - an external system to store and organize information, freeing your mind to focus on thinking and creativity rather than remembering. Reference Tiago Forte's work.]

### Other Related Concepts

[To be written: Brief comparison with related methodologies like:
- Digital gardens
- Zettelkasten
- Getting Things Done (GTD)
- Personal wiki systems]

## Patterns

### PARA

**Projects - Areas - Resources - Archives**

A organizational system created by Tiago Forte for managing digital information.

- **Projects**: Short-term efforts with specific goals and deadlines
- **Areas**: Long-term responsibilities and interests to maintain
- **Resources**: Topics of ongoing interest and reference material
- **Archives**: Inactive items from the other three categories

### ACE

**Actionable - Contextual - Evergreen**

[To be written: Explain the ACE framework for categorizing notes and information based on their purpose and lifecycle.]

### Zettelkasten

The "slip-box" method developed by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. A note-taking system based on:

- Atomic notes (one idea per note)
- Linking between related ideas
- Building a network of knowledge over time
- Emergence of insights through connections

### Other Patterns

[To be written: Additional organizational patterns to consider:
- Johnny Decimal system
- LIFT (Locate, Identify, File, Transform)
- CODE (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express)
- Progressive summarization]

## Tools

### OneNote

Microsoft's digital notebook application.

**Pros:**
- Familiar interface for Microsoft users
- Good handwriting and drawing support
- Free with Microsoft account
- Cross-platform syncing

**Cons:**
- Limited linking between notes
- Less flexible organization
- Proprietary format

### Notion

All-in-one workspace combining notes, databases, and collaboration.

**Pros:**
- Powerful database features
- Flexible page structures
- Great for teams and collaboration
- Templates and embeds

**Cons:**
- Can be slow with large databases
- Requires internet connection
- Learning curve for advanced features
- Data stored in cloud only

### Obsidian

Markdown-based knowledge base that works on local files.

**Pros:**
- Plain text Markdown files (future-proof)
- Powerful linking and backlinks
- Graph view for visualizing connections
- Local-first with optional syncing
- Extensive plugin ecosystem

**Cons:**
- Steeper learning curve
- Requires Markdown knowledge
- Paid sync service (or DIY solutions)
- Less polished mobile experience

### Other Tools

[To be written: Brief mentions of:
- Roam Research
- Logseq
- Evernote
- Apple Notes
- Remnote
- Craft
- Bear]

## PARA

### Why PARA?

[To be written: Explain the benefits of using PARA:
- Reduces cognitive load
- Matches how we actually work
- Actionability-focused
- Easy to maintain
- Works across different tools]

### Structure

The PARA structure organizes information from most to least actionable:

1. **Projects** (Most Actionable)
   - Current work with deadlines
   - Active goals requiring attention
   - Temporary by nature
   
2. **Areas**
   - Ongoing responsibilities
   - Standards to maintain
   - No end date
   
3. **Resources**
   - Reference materials
   - Topics of interest
   - Learning materials
   
4. **Archives** (Least Actionable)
   - Completed projects
   - Inactive areas
   - Historical reference

### Most Actionable to Least

The key insight of PARA is organizing by actionability rather than topic or theme. This keeps you focused on what matters now while still preserving information for later.

**Why this matters:**
- Reduces decision fatigue
- Surfaces what needs attention
- Makes reviews more efficient
- Aligns with natural work rhythms

## My Twist on It

While PARA provides an excellent foundation, I've added some modifications to fit my workflow:

### Promoted: Inbox

A dedicated inbox or capture system that sits above the PARA structure:

- **Quick capture**: Dump thoughts, ideas, and items without friction
- **Daily/weekly processing**: Review and sort into appropriate PARA categories
- **Zero inbox goal**: Keep it empty through regular review
- **Multiple inboxes**: Email, voice notes, browser captures, etc.

[To be written: Elaborate on your specific inbox workflow and tools]

### Journal

A dedicated space for time-based entries:

- **Daily notes**: Reflections, logs, and time-stamped thoughts
- **Separate from PARA**: Doesn't fit the actionability model
- **Linking to PARA**: Can reference projects, areas, and resources
- **Review mechanism**: Weekly/monthly review of journal entries

[To be written: Describe your journaling practice and how it integrates]

### Templates

Standardized formats for common note types:

- **Project templates**: Consistent structure for new projects
- **Meeting notes**: Standard format for meetings and discussions
- **Decision logs**: Template for documenting important decisions
- **Review templates**: Weekly/monthly/quarterly review formats

[To be written: Share specific templates you use and why]

## Next Steps

[To be written: Outline your plan moving forward:
- Implementing the system
- Tools to evaluate
- Migration from existing systems
- Habits to develop
- Metrics for success
- Iteration and refinement plans]
