I've been interested in personal knowledge management for well over a decade now. Like many others, I started with OneNote - adding sections, creating pages for different subjects and categories in my life. It worked. For a while.
 
Then it became unwieldy. So I'd reorganise. Create a new structure. Feel in control again. And then, inevitably, watch it spiral back into chaos. Rinse and repeat... for years.

If you've ever felt that cycle of organisation-followed-by-overwhelm, this post is for you.

## What Even Is PKM?

Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is exactly what it sounds like: a system for capturing, organising, and retrieving the information that matters to you. Some call it a "Second Brain": an external system that extends your memory and thinking capacity.

The terminology varies. The goal doesn't: stop losing ideas, find what you need when you need it, and actually *use* what you've learned.

## The Patterns I Explored

When my notes became perpetually messier, I started investigating systems that others had built:

- **Zettelkasten:** Atomic notes, heavily interlinked. Fascinating in theory, but the numbering systems felt dated in an age of search and custom sorting.
- **Johnny Decimal:**  Numeric categorisation. Elegant, but I wanted folders that said what they *were*, not what number they'd been assigned.
- **ACE (Atlas, Calendar, Efforts):**  Nick Milo's approach from Linking Your Thinking. Interesting philosophy around emergence.
- **PARA:**  Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive. Tiago Forte's system.

And PARA? This was revolutionary for me.

## Why PARA Changed Everything

The categorisation of Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive was exactly what I needed. But after years of practice, honing, and learning, here's what I feel most people miss when they first encounter PARA: it's not really about the folders.

The underlying philosophy is what makes it work: **higher actionability sits higher in the stack**.

*Actionability is the hidden power behind PARA that most people miss.*

- **Projects** are active, time-bound work. Most actionable.
- **Areas** are ongoing responsibilities with no end date.
- **Resources** are reference material—useful but not urgent.
- **Archive** is inactive. Least actionable, but preserved.

This spectrum of actionability lets me concentrate on what matters while still having a place for everything else. Nearly a decade later, I'm still using PARA as my foundation. But I've made adjustments.

## My Twist: Promoting the Inbox and Journal

I've pulled two concepts out and given them their own space:

**The Inbox:**  Capture first, decide later. Zero friction. Anything can go here and the *triage* (sorting into PARA+ folders) happens later. This separation is crucial: it means I never hesitate to write something down because I'm not sure where it belongs.

**The Journal:**  This is where things get interesting. Every note that is triaged out of the inbox gets logged in my daily journal with a link to wherever that note is moved to. Think of it like Zettelkasten's linking philosophy, but with time as the spine.

*Random notes get captured and funnelled into the vault through triage.*

Why does this matter? If I remember I had a project idea on a specific day, I can find the journal entry and follow the link. If I'm in the project file, I can trace back to the moment that idea was born, what I was doing, other events or things that happened around that time, what I was thinking, how I was feeling. Context that would otherwise be lost.

## The Tools Along the Way

I spent years in **OneNote**. It genuinely has great features: stylus support, audio notes, handwriting recognition. It's served me well.

But when AI CLI tools started maturing, I realised something: AI could help manage my notebook, but only if my notes were in a format AI could easily read. OneNote's proprietary format wasn't it.

So I migrated to **Obsidian**; local-first, markdown-based, and tons of useful plugins. With ChatGPT's help, I exported my OneNote sections to PDF and converted them to markdown. Painful, but worth it.

Other tools exist, good ones, better ones even. And I presume they'll have AI implementations in no time, but I want something more: **customisation** (and I want it now).

## Where AI Fits In

And so this leads me to my present journey.

After discovering Claude CLI, an AI that could read and modify documents on my computer, I realised a new kind of augmentation was possible.

I can have AI look over my journal and tell me about myself. Could I improve some aspect of my processes? Is there a long forgotten project I could revisit? Am I overanalysing certain things? Are there patterns I haven't consciously noticed? These are questions I never thought I'd be able to ask my notes.

With a promoted Inbox, AI helps me triage. I drop notes in and depending on whether it's a research note or a quick log entry, the AI picks it up, decides whether to help research, whether to create or update projects etc. Over the last few months, a select few AI models have become remarkably accurate, partly because of improvements, partly because I've also improved at describing my processes.

Right now, these steps are manual. I type into my Inbox, then ask AI to triage it. But I'm working toward automation: notes that process themselves, voice recordings from my phone that transcribe and flow into my vault without me touching a keyboard.

## What's Next

This post is the beginning of a series. I'll be diving deeper into:

- The Journal system and atomic rollup
- How I'm building AI automation into my PKM workflow
- The friction points I'm still solving

If you're drowning in notes, or you've never quite found a system that sticks, I hope my journey gives you some ideas—or at least the reassurance that everyone struggles with this.

The perfect system doesn't exist. But a system that evolves with you? That's worth building.
