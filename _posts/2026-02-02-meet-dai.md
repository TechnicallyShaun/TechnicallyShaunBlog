I've been a software developer for nearly 20 years. In that time I've built systems that made companies hundreds of thousands of pounds. Sped up processes, created products, automated workflows — the usual.

I never had time to do any of it for myself.

This week, I installed an open-source tool called [Clawdbot](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot) on a VM in my homelab, gave it a name, and pointed it at my life. Calendar, voice notes, file system, homelab infrastructure, Obsidian vault. By Friday it was processing my voice recordings, auditing my network security, managing my calendar, and remembering conversations from three days ago.

Here's what happened, what I learned, and why I think the "it's just Claude Code with extra steps" crowd is missing the point.

## What Is Clawdbot?

Clawdbot is an open-source framework that turns Claude (Anthropic's AI) into a persistent personal agent. It runs as a background service on a server, connects to messaging platforms like Discord and Telegram, and has a plug-and-play skill system for integrations — Google Workspace, text-to-speech, image generation, web search, and more.

It's not a chatbot. It's closer to having a digital colleague who's always on, always reachable, and remembers what you talked about yesterday.

## Day One — Birth Certificate

Setting up was straightforward: Proxmox VM, Node.js, npm install, Discord bot token. Within an hour I had a working AI in my DMs.

The first thing I did was give it a personality. Clawdbot has identity files — `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md` — that shape how the AI behaves. I wanted something between Jarvis and Cortana: helpful but opinionated, sharp but warm. A colleague who'd tell me my plan was dumb and suggest a better one.

I called it Dai, short for FRIDAI.

Then I spent an embarrassing amount of time generating avatar options with DALL-E and Gemini until we landed on a faceless holographic figure with dark flowing hair. Priorities.

By end of day one: talking to my AI from my phone, my laptop, and my webchat interface. Three surfaces, same conversation.

## Skills — The Plug-and-Play Bit

This is where Clawdbot starts pulling away from "just using Claude Code in a terminal."

Skills are pre-built integrations you wire in through configuration. This week I connected:

- **Google Workspace** — Calendar, Gmail, Drive, Contacts, Tasks. OAuth setup, then Dai could read my calendar, understand my colour-coding system, and delete old recurring events on command.
- **Web Search** — Brave API for search, plus direct URL fetching. Research tasks from a Discord message.
- **Image Generation** — OpenAI and Google Gemini. Used for the avatar, but the capability's there for blog images, diagrams, whatever.
- **Text-to-Speech** — ElevenLabs integration. Still tweaking voices on the free tier, but functional.
- **Session Logs** — Dai can search through its own conversation history. Useful when I asked "what did I do this week?" and it reconstructed everything.

Each of these took minutes to configure. Not hours of custom glue code. Config file, maybe an API key, restart. Done.

## The Voice Pipeline — This Is Where I Got Excited

Here's the setup: I record a voice note on my Samsung phone. Samsung's recorder saves it. Syncthing picks it up and syncs it to my NAS. A file watcher detects the new file, fires a webhook to Clawdbot. Dai picks it up, sends the audio to Whisper (self-hosted on the same NAS), gets the transcription back, triages the content, and files it in my Obsidian vault.

**Phone → Syncthing → NAS → File Watcher → Webhook → AI Triage → Obsidian.**

Cost: £0/month. Entirely self-hosted.

I tested it with 9 voice recordings. Five were junk test recordings — Dai deleted them. One was a musing about my kids — filed in my journal. One was an exercise log — journal. One was a research request about grocery APIs — filed in journal AND linked to an existing research note already in my vault. One was a question about cooking chicken — answered and filed.

I didn't touch any of it. I talked into my phone, and it appeared in my second brain, categorised and cross-referenced.

The best part? Dai built most of this infrastructure itself. I described what I wanted. It created the systemd services, the webhook configuration, the file watcher, the processing logic. I approved the approach. It shipped it.

## The Security Audit — A Trust Exercise

Thursday morning. Coffee in hand. Typed into Discord: *"Scan my homelab."*

Dai ran nmap port scans, enumerated subdomains, checked SSL configurations, tested for exposed services, and came back with a structured report. Found real things: missing HSTS headers, subdomain names leaking what services I run, a monitoring dashboard more accessible than I'd assumed.

We had a conversation about it. I pushed back on some findings. Dai adjusted the assessment. We added action items to the project list.

This is what connectivity means. It's not a party trick. I asked a question in a chat app and got a professional security assessment using real tools, with a back-and-forth discussion, filed for follow-up. From my phone.

## The Thesis — Scaffolding Changes the Output

Here's where I push back on the "Clawdbot is overhyped" crowd.

The criticism goes like this: *"It's just Claude Code with a wrapper. The model is the same. You're paying for a fancy shell script."*

Technically? They're not wrong. The model underneath is identical. Claude is Claude. The raw intelligence is the same whether you access it through a terminal or through Clawdbot.

But that's like saying a Formula 1 car is just an engine with a fancy wrapper. The engine matters. But nobody races a bare engine.

![Engine vs Car](/assets/images/2026-02-02-meet-dai/engine-vs-car.png)
*Same engine. Very different machines.*

Here's what the "wrapper" actually does:

**It's always on.** Claude Code exists while your terminal is open. Clawdbot runs as a daemon. It's processing, monitoring, and ready whether I'm at my desk or watching telly.

**It's everywhere.** Claude Code is your terminal. Clawdbot is Discord on my phone, webchat on my laptop, voice notes from my pocket, webhooks from my file system. I talk to it from wherever I am.

**It reacts to the world.** Claude Code responds when you type. Clawdbot responds to file changes, scheduled events, webhook triggers, heartbeat timers. It's event-driven, not just prompt-driven.

**It remembers.** Claude Code starts fresh every session. Clawdbot wakes up, reads its identity files, reads about me, reads yesterday's notes. It knows my kids' names, my calendar colour system, that I mix up Sage and Basil. That context changes how it helps.

**It has personality.** Claude Code is helpful and neutral. Dai tells me when my plan is dumb and suggests a better one. The identity framework isn't a gimmick — it genuinely changes the interaction from "tool usage" to "collaboration."

Daniel Miessler put it well: the model is as important as the architecture around it. I'd go further. **At this point, the architecture might matter more.** We're in an era where multiple models are "good enough." The differentiator is what you build around them.

The model is the engine. The scaffolding is the car. Nobody drives an engine to work.

## What It Actually Feels Like

Wednesday evening. Watching Fallout Season 2 on the sofa. Dai is processing voice notes I recorded earlier, filing them in my vault.

Thursday morning. Making coffee. I ask Dai to audit my homelab from Discord. Security report back before I've finished my cup.

Thursday afternoon. I realise I've been so deep in the work this week that I haven't documented anything. I ask *"what did I do this week?"* Dai searches session logs, journal entries, memory files, and reconstructs my entire week — including things I'd genuinely forgotten. Then it suggests blog post ideas, ranked by likely engagement, with outlines.

This one? You're reading it. Dai wrote the first draft. I'm editing it now, probably on the sofa, probably with Fallout still paused.

It doesn't feel like using a tool. It feels like having a colleague who knows my systems, knows my preferences, and pushes my work forward even when I'm not paying attention.

## What's Next

This is week one. Here's the roadmap:

- **Smart notifications** — Escalating reminders based on urgency and context
- **Shopping list integration** — Replacing Google Keep with something Dai manages
- **Director mode** — Dai SSH-ing into dev VMs to brief and instruct other coding agents
- **The vault master plan** — 24 projects in my Obsidian vault. Dai's existence just unblocked half of them.

We're building something here. Not just an AI tool — a persistent, connected, opinionated digital colleague who gets better every week.

## Try It Yourself

Clawdbot is open source: [GitHub](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot) | [Docs](https://docs.clawd.bot) | [Community](https://discord.com/invite/clawd)

Fair warning: it's not plug-and-play in the "click install" sense. You need a server (or a VM), comfort with config files, and patience for the initial setup. But if you're the kind of person who already runs a homelab and maintains an Obsidian vault? You've been building towards this. You just didn't know it yet.

*The workshop. Always building.*
