# About

## The Current Obsession

I'm trying to use technology with my new found love of AI to automate and augment the boring stuff in life.

Currently building what I call **The Self-Driving Vault** - basically trying to get AI agents to organize my Obsidian notes so I don't have to. Everyone's got a messy vault. Everyone wants AI to fix it. I'm the guy actually attempting it and documenting the chaos.

The dream? A second brain that actually thinks, so I don't have to use my own.
The reality? Mostly debugging why Claude keeps putting grocery lists in my project folders.

## What This Site Is

A mix of tutorials, experiments, and "well that didn't work" moments. I build things, break things, occasionally fix things, and write about all of it. Topics drift wherever my attention goes - right now that's autonomous knowledge management, AI agents, and convincing robots to do my filing.

No promises on consistency. I'm easily distracted by shiny new problems.

## The Approach

Everything here comes from stuff I actually use. I build it, live in it, then extract what works. No toy examples or theoretical frameworks - just real automation solving real problems (and sometimes creating new ones).
