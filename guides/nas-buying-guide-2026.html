        <h1>Best NAS for Homelab in 2026 — A Practical Buyer's Guide</h1>
        <p class="meta">Published: January 2026 · Updated: February 2026 · Reading time: 7 minutes</p>

        <p>If you're running a homelab — or thinking about starting one — a NAS (Network Attached Storage) is probably the single most useful piece of hardware you can add. It's your media server, your backup target, your Docker host, and your central file store all in one box.</p>

        <p>But the market in 2026 is crowded. Synology, QNAP, Terramaster, Asustor, and even DIY builds with TrueNAS or Unraid all compete for your money. This guide cuts through the noise and tells you what actually matters.</p>

        <h2>What to Look For</h2>

        <p>Before you compare specific models, understand the specs that matter for a homelab NAS:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bay count:</strong> 2-bay is fine for media streaming. 4-bay is the sweet spot for homelabs. 6+ bays if you're serious about storage or running VMs.</li>
            <li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Celeron J-series or N-series handles Plex transcoding, Docker containers, and light VM work. ARM chips are cheaper but limit your software options.</li>
            <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 4GB minimum, 8GB+ recommended. More RAM means better caching and more containers.</li>
            <li><strong>Network:</strong> 2.5GbE is the new baseline. Don't buy a NAS in 2026 with only gigabit ethernet — the bottleneck will drive you mad.</li>
            <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> NVMe slots for caching, USB 3.2 for external drives, and ideally PCIe for a 10GbE card down the line.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Contenders</h2>

        <h3>Synology DS923+ (4-bay, ~£500)</h3>
        <p>The default recommendation for a reason. Synology's DSM operating system is genuinely excellent — intuitive, well-documented, and has a massive community. Docker support via Container Manager works well. Plex runs natively. Surveillance Station is included (2 camera licenses free).</p>
        <p>The downsides: Synology locks you into their ecosystem somewhat (proprietary RAID format, their own DDNS service), and the hardware is slightly overpriced for what you get spec-wise. You're paying for the software.</p>

        <h3>QNAP TS-464 (4-bay, ~£450)</h3>
        <p>Better hardware per pound than Synology. Intel N5105 quad-core, dual 2.5GbE ports, two NVMe slots, and HDMI output. QTS has improved significantly, though it's still not as polished as DSM.</p>
        <p>The caveat: QNAP has had notable security incidents. Their track record on patching vulnerabilities isn't great. If you expose a QNAP to the internet, you need to be vigilant about updates.</p>

        <h3>Terramaster F4-424 Pro (4-bay, ~£400)</h3>
        <p>The value pick. Intel N305 8-core processor, 32GB DDR5 RAM out of the box, dual 2.5GbE. TOS (Terramaster Operating System) is functional but less mature than DSM or QTS. Great for people who plan to run TrueNAS or Unraid instead of the stock OS.</p>
        <p>The downside: community is smaller, documentation is thinner, and the stock OS lacks some quality-of-life features that Synology users take for granted.</p>

        <h3>DIY Build (Varies, £300-800)</h3>
        <p>An old mini PC or a purpose-built system running TrueNAS SCALE or Unraid. Maximum flexibility, maximum control, maximum headaches. If you enjoy the building process as much as the using process, this is the way.</p>

        <p>For a 4-bay NAS, a good rule of thumb is to budget about 10% of the total drive cost for replacement spares. With 8TB drives sitting around £150 each in early 2026, that means keeping £60-80 aside for emergencies. It's not exciting, but it's insurance.</p>

        <h2>RAID Configuration</h2>
        <p>A quick note that catches out every beginner: <strong>RAID is not a backup</strong>. RAID protects against drive failure. It does not protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, fire, flood, or theft. You still need proper backups — ideally following the 3-2-1 rule (3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite).</p>

        <p>For a 4-bay NAS:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RAID 5 / SHR:</strong> One drive of redundancy. Good balance of capacity and protection. Lose one drive, you're fine. Lose two, you're gone.</li>
            <li><strong>RAID 6 / SHR-2:</strong> Two drives of redundancy. Safer but you lose more capacity.</li>
            <li><strong>RAID 10:</strong> Mirrored pairs. Best performance, worst capacity. Good for databases or VM storage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What About Drives?</h2>
        <p>NAS-rated drives (WD Red Plus, Seagate IronWolf, Toshiba N300) are designed for 24/7 operation and multi-bay vibration. Desktop drives <em>can</em> work but aren't rated for it and their warranties usually don't cover NAS use.</p>

        <p>Capacity sweet spot in 2026: <strong>8TB drives</strong>. Best price per terabyte, widely available, and four of them in RAID 5 gives you 24TB usable — plenty for most homelabs.</p>

        <h2>My Recommendation</h2>
        <p>If you want something that just works: <strong>Synology DS923+</strong> with 4x 8TB drives in SHR. It's not the cheapest, but the software experience and community support make it the safest choice for someone who wants to spend their time using the NAS, not fixing it.</p>

        <p>If you're comfortable with Linux and want more power per pound: <strong>Terramaster F4-424 Pro</strong> with TrueNAS SCALE. The hardware is genuinely impressive for the price, and TrueNAS gives you ZFS, proper Docker support, and a massive community.</p>

        <p>If you already have a PC gathering dust: <strong>DIY with Unraid</strong>. The license is cheap, the community is brilliant, and you get to reuse hardware you already own.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>A NAS is one of those homelab purchases that pays for itself in utility within weeks. Start with what you can afford, configure your RAID and backups properly, and don't overthink it. The best NAS is the one you actually set up and use.</p>

        <p>Whatever you pick: remember that RAID is not a backup. Set up offsite backups on day one. Future you will thank present you.</p>
